how do i do the abstractionings

at the time i created this repo, i didn't understand how Classes/Abstraction worked. 
that means the earlier submissions are a seriously unorganized mess. now that i know what i'm doing things are a lot easier.

1) apart from test data and Javadocs, documentation is not included in the repo
2) if this looks clumsily bodged together, that's because it is. my focus right now is just getting a working program, and then i can take what i've learned and rebuild a nice clean version.
